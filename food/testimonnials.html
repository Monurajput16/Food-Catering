        <h2>GUS V.</h2>
        <P >I wanted to thank you and your staff for the work you did to make the Elgin Sports Hall of Fame banquet an outstanding success.  We had many positive comments that evening as well as the days following the event. From the time that we started planning our event with you until the end of the evening, you made yourself accessible and were very easy to work with.
            <br><br>
            Your staff were very attentive to our guest’s needs and conducted themselves in a very professional manner.
            <br><br>
            On the night of the banquet, I personally heard many positive comments about the quality of food that you and your staff prepared for us.
            <br><br>
            In addition, clearing place settings and serving dessert to over 270 guests in no way disturbed our program for the evening.  This was noticed and appreciated. You can be certain that we will be contacting you as soon as we start planning for next year’s event.
            <br><br>
            Thanks again</P>

<p >Jeff and his crew did a fantastic job at our wedding last Saturday!  
<br><br>
    He brought the vision for our dinner, Southern Style, to life with barbequed short ribs, buttermilk roasted chicken, macaroni and cheese, Brussel sprouts, coleslaw, and cornbread/biscuits.  He was very attentive when we wanted things tweaked and executed them to perfection. The family style serving ensured that everyone had enough of exactly what they wanted and our guests loved it.  We had several, SEVERAL, of our guests come up to us to not only compliment the food, but the family style, and even the shabby chic plates (nearly everyone has a different plate). The shabby chic is part of what sold us.  At our first tasting and this was totally random, I was eating off of my grandparents plates, while my now wife was eating off of plates she grew up with.
    <br><br>
    We even stole Jeff's music from our tastings for our wedding dinner.  We're big country music fans and he had it on during each and every tasting and we just loved the atmosphere.  
    <br><br>
    We may be biased, but we both agreed we've never been to a wedding with better food!  Our only wish was that we had more of an appetite the night of. Jeff and his crew even made sure we had appetizers at our table since we missed most of them while we were mingling during our cocktail hour.</p>

   <h2> ALYSSA T.</h2>
Jeff & the  staff are incredible! They catered our wedding and I'd hire them again and again. From our initial conversations to the end our wedding night, Jeff was friendly, creative, and very professional. He took our menu ideas and elevated them to another level. Jeff is extremely approachable and made us feel comfortable going into our big day. His food is delicious and was enjoyed by all. Jeff and his staff executed everything perfectly and we're still being told how amazing our wedding food was! You're in good hands with Jeff!
<br><br>
<h2>ALISA K. </h2>
This will be the best, easiest, and most fun reviews I write. Jeff is simply amazing and so is his food. His staff.....even they are amazing. Kyle and I got married on November 4th, 2016 at THE HAIGHT. Jeff truly goes above and beyond in just providing a delicious meal for 130 people. He makes you feel like a King and Queen on your special day. He has instilled that in his staff as well. He truly cares about what "YOU" want and hesitates at nothing to get it accomplished. Everything is always in the details and it is the little things that always stand out. That's another value that he executes seamlessly. It is about being honest and pure. I wish him the best of luck and he deserves back all that he does for people ten fold. It's coming for you Jeff. I can't wait to host another party for you to cater. Cheers!
